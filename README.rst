A Python interface to access `Lanner PSP`_.

About
=====

`Lanner PSP`_ aims to simplify and enhance the efficiency of customer’s application implementation.
When developers intend to write an application that involves hardware access, they were required
to fully understand the specifications to utilize the drivers. This is often being considered a time-
consuming job which requires lots of related knowledge and time. In order to achieve better full
access hardware functionality, Lanner_ invests great effort to ease customer’s development journey
with the release of a suite of reliable Software APIs.

"Python API for Lanner PSP" uses Python to call the shared object file generated after PSP compilation
to execute PSP functions, and encapsulates many C functions in PSP into Python interfaces, so please
make sure to install `Core SDK`_ before use.

If your `Core SDK`_ was installed via the `One-Step Automated Install`_ method, you can use it out of
the box, otherwise you should set the ``liblmbio.so`` and ``liblmbapi.so`` paths before instantiating
other objects. For example:

.. code:: python

    from lannerpsp import PSP, HWM

    PSP.lmb_io_path = "/path/to/liblmbio.so"
    PSP.lmb_api_path = "/path/to/liblmbapi.so"

    hwm = HWM()

    hwm.get_cpu_temp(1)
    ...

Assuming you want to obtain the sensors data for the hardware monitor:

.. code:: python

    from lannerpsp import HWM

    hwm = HWM()

    sensors = hwm.list_supported_sensors()
    for s in sensors:
        print(f"{s.display_name} = {s.value} {s.unit}")

Then run it with **ROOT** privileges, the output will be like:

.. code:: console

    CPU 1 temperature = 41 C
    SYS 1 temperature = 42 C
    CPU 1 Vcore = 0.856 V
    5V = 5.087 V
    3.3V = 3.35 V
    Battery = 3.184 V
    DDR channel 1 = 1.104 V

For complete usage, please refer to the documents_.
